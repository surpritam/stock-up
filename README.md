# Stock-up
Project 1 - Stock Info News feed

## Description
This webpage is part of a group project that required the usage of at least 2 server-side API's, it must use client-side storage to store persistent data, it must have a polished UI and meet good quality coding standards, as well as being interactive.

## Usage
The webpage will allow the user to search stocks from the S&P500, it has an autocomplete function that will fill from a list of S&P500 stocks. It will display relevant stock information of what was searched, and it will be shown in a chart form, along with news and market information pertaining to the company. There will be a record of past searches and can be clicked on to see the most current information. 
We have also incorporated the use of some financial widgets from Trading View: https://www.tradingview.com/widget-docs/widgets/tickers/ticker-tape/ such as the ticker tape and stock chart widgets.
For the financial data, we are using seeking-alpha: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/seeking-alpha found on RapidAPI.com and for the stock news, we are using real-time Finance Data: https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-finance-data found on RapidAPI.com.
